# Scribium App
A future advanced gradebook mobile application, connected with a custom backend written by a passionated mobile developer. 

Scribium app is a flutter project creating in a free time, to learn and expand knowledge about security, backends, and network connections.

This app will probably never be used in production. **It is made just for fun**.

## What are the goals of this application?
At the end, I would like to have a responsize application with a stable connection to the backend, which **could** be used by schools to save grades in a safe way.

 - [x] Create an intro screen
 - [x] Create a login screen
	 - [x] Login system
 - [x] Make a connection with a backend
	 - [x] Save information in the user model
 - [ ] Allow user to view some details about the account
 - [ ] Downloading grades from the backend
 - [ ] Downloading information about the school from the backend
 - [ ] Give possbility to change password in a safe way

**This list may be expanded, because for now I don't have a fixed plan.** ~~Just trying to copy some different gradebook application on google playstore~~
